              <p>My name is Adam Mayblum. I am alive today. I am committing this
              to paper; so I never forget. SO WE NEVER FORGET. I am sure that
              this is one of thousands of stories that will emerge over the next
              several days and weeks. I arrived as usual a little before 8am. My
              office was on the 87th floor of 1 World Trade Center, AKA: Tower
              1, AKA: the North Tower. Most of my associates were in by 8:30m.
              We were standing around, joking around, eating breakfast, checking
              emails, and getting set for the day when the first plane hit just
              a few stories above us. I must stress that we did not know that it
              was a plane. The building lurched violently and shook as if it
              were an earthquake. People screamed. I watched out my window as
              the building seemed to move 10 to 20 feet in each direction. It
              rumbled and shook long enough for me to get my wits about myself
              and grab a co-worker and seek shelter under a doorway. Light
              fixtures and parts of the ceiling collapsed. The kitchen was
              destroyed. We were certain that it was a bomb. We looked out the
              windows. Reams of paper were flying everywhere, like a ticker tape
              parade. I looked down at the street. I could see people in Battery
              Park City looking up. Smoke started billowing in through the holes
              in the ceiling. I believe that there were 13 of us. We did not
              panic. I can only assume that we thought that the worst was over.
              The building was standing and we were shaken but alive. We checked
              the halls. The smoke was thick and white and did not smell like I
              imagined smoke should smell. Not like your BBQ or your fireplace
              or even a bonfire. The phones were working. My wife had taken our
              9 month old for his check up. I called my nanny at home and told
              her to page my wife, tell her that a bomb went off, I was OK, and
              on my way out. I grabbed my laptop. Took off my tee shirt and
              ripped it into 3 pieces. Soaked it in water. Gave 2 pieces to my
              friends. Tied my piece around my face to act as an air filter. And
              we all started moving to the staircase. One of my dearest friends
              said that he was staying until the police or firemen came to get
              him. In the halls there were tiny fires and sparks. The ceiling
              had collapsed in the men's bathroom. It was gone along with anyone
              who may have been in there. We did not go in to look. We missed
              the staircase on the first run and had to double back. Once in the
              staircase we picked up fire extinguishers just in case. On the
              85th floor a brave associate of mine and I headed back up to our
              office to drag out my partner who stayed behind. There was no air,
              just white smoke. We made the rounds through the office calling
              his name. No response. He must have succumbed to the smoke. We
              left defeated in our efforts and made our way back to the
              stairwell. We proceeded to the 78th floor where we had to change
              over to a different stairwell. 78 is the main junction to switch
              to the upper floors. I expected to see more people. There were
              some 50 to 60 more. Not enough. Wires and fires all over the
              place. Smoke too. A brave man was fighting a fire with the
              emergency hose. I stopped with to friends to make sure that
              everyone from our office was accounted for. We ushered them and
              confused people into the stairwell. In retrospect, I recall seeing
              Harry, my head trader, doing the same several yards behind me. I
              am only 35. I have known him for over 14 years. I headed into the
              stairwell with 2 friends.</p>
              <p>We were moving down very orderly in Stair Case A. very slowly.
              No panic. At least not overt panic. My legs could not stop
              shaking. My heart was pounding. Some nervous jokes and laughter. I
              made a crack about ruining a brand new pair of Merrells. Even
              still, they were right, my feet felt great. We all laughed. We
              checked our cell phones. Surprisingly, there was a very good
              signal, but the Sprint network was jammed. I heard that the
              Blackberry 2 way email devices worked perfectly. On the phones, 1
              out of 20 dial attempts got through. I knew I could not reach my
              wife so I called my parents. I told them what happened and that we
              were all okay and on the way down. Soon, my sister in law reached
              me. I told her we were fine and moving down. I believe that was
              about the 65th floor. We were bored and nervous. I called my
              friend Angel in San Francisco. I knew he would be watching. He was
              amazed I was on the phone. He told me to get out that there was
              another plane on its way. I did not know what he was talking
              about. By now the second plane had struck Tower 2. We were so deep
              into the middle of our building that we did not hear or feel
              anything. We had no idea what was really going on. We kept making
              way for wounded to go down ahead of us. Not many of them, just a
              few. No one seemed seriously wounded. Just some cuts and scrapes.
              Everyone cooperated. Everyone was a hero yesterday. No questions
              asked. I had coworkers in another office on the 77th floor. I
              tried dozens of times to get them on their cell phones or office
              lines. It was futile. Later I found that they were alive. One of
              the many miracles on a day of tragedy.</p>
              <p>On the 53rd floor we came across a very heavyset man sitting on
              the stairs. I asked if he needed help or was he just resting. He
              needed help. I knew I would have trouble carrying him because I
              have a very bad back. But my friend and I offered anyway. We told
              him he could lean on us. He hesitated, I don't know why. I said do
              you want to come or do you want us to send help for you. He chose
              for help. I told him he was on the 53rd floor in Stairwell A and that's
              what I would tell the rescue workers. He said okay and we left.</p>
              <p>On the 44th floor my phone rang again. It was my parents. They
              were hysterical. I said relax, I'm fine. My father said get out,
              there is third plane coming. I still did not understand. I was
              kind of angry. What did my parents think? Like I needed some other
              reason to get going? I couldn't move the thousand people in front
              of me any faster. I know they love me, but no one inside
              understood what the situation really was. My parents did. Starting
              around this floor the firemen, policemen, WTC K-9 units without
              the dogs, anyone with a badge, started coming up as we were
              heading down. I stopped a lot of them and told them about the man
              on 53 and my friend on 87. I later felt terrible about this. They
              headed up to find those people and met death instead.</p>
              <p>On the 33rd floor I spoke with a man who somehow new most of
              the details. He said 2 small planes hit the building. Now we all
              started talking about which terrorist group it was. Was it an
              internal organization or an external one? The overwhelming but
              uninformed opinion was Islamic Fanatics. Regardless, we now knew
              that it was not a bomb and there were potentially more planes
              coming. We understood. &amp; felt this rumbling coming towards us
              from above. I thought the staircase was collapsing upon itself. It
              was 10am now and that was Tower 2 collapsing next door. We did not
              know that. Someone had a flashlight. We passed it forward and left
              the stairwell and headed down a dark and cramped corridor to an
              exit. We could not see at all. I recommended that everyone place a
              hand on the shoulder of the person in front of them and call out
              if they hit an obstacle so others would know to avoid it. They
              did. It worked perfectly. We reached another stairwell and saw a
              female officer emerge soaking wet and covered in soot. She said we
              could not go that way it was blocked. Go up to 4 and use the other
              exit. Just as we started up she said it was OK to go down instead.
              There was water everywhere. I called out for hands on shoulders
              again and she said that was a great idea. She stayed behind
              instructing people to do that. I do not know what happened to her.</p>
              <p>We emerged into an enormous room. It was light but filled with
              smoke. I commented to a friend that it must be under construction.
              Then we realized where we were. It was the second floor. The one
              that overlooks the lobby. We were ushered out into the courtyard,
              the one where the fountain used to be. My first thought was of a
              TV movie I saw once about nuclear winter and fallout. I could not
              understand where all of the debris came from. There was at least
              five inches of this gray pasty dusty drywall soot on the ground as
              well as a thickness of it in the air. Twisted steel and wires. I
              heard there were bodies and body parts as well, but I did not
              look. It was bad enough. We hid under the remaining overhangs and
              moved out to the street. We were told to keep walking towards
              Houston Street. The odd thing is that there were very few rescue
              workers around. Less than five. They all must have been trapped
              under the debris when Tower 2 fell. We did not know that and could
              not understand where all of that debris came from. It was just my
              friend Kern and I now. We were hugging but sad. We felt certain
              that most of our friends ahead of us died and we knew no one
              behind us.</p>
              <p>We came upon a post office several blocks away. We stopped and
              looked up. Our building, exactly where our office is (was), was
              engulfed in flame and smoke. A postal worker said that Tower 2 had
              fallen down. I looked again and sure enough it was gone. My heart
              was racing. We kept trying to call our families. I could not get
              in touch with my wife. Finally I got through to my parents.
              Relived is not the word to explain their feelings. They got
              through to my wife, thank G-d and let her know I was alive. We sat
              down. A girl on a bike offered us some water. Just as she took the
              cap off her bottle we heard a rumble. We looked up and our
              building, Tower 1 collapsed. I did not note the time but I am told
              it was 10:30am. We had been out less than 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>We were mourning our lost friends, particularly the one who
              stayed in the office as we were now sure that he had perished. We
              started walking towards Union Square. I was going to Beth Israel
              Medical Center to be looked at. We stopped to hear the President
              speaking on the radio. My phone rang. It was my wife. I think I
              fell to my knees crying when I heard her voice. Then she told me
              the most incredible thing. My partner who had stayed behind called
              her. He was alive and well. I guess we just lost him in the
              commotion. We started jumping and hugging and shouting. I told my
              wife that my brother had arranged for a hotel in midtown. He can
              be very resourceful in that way. I told her I would call her from
              there. My brother and I managed to get a gypsy cab to take us home
              to Westchester instead. I cried on my son and held my wife until I
              fell asleep.</p>
              <p>As it turns out my partner, the one who I thought had stayed
              behind was behind us with Harry Ramos, our head trader. This is
              now second hand information. They came upon Victor, the heavyset
              man on the 53rd floor. They helped him. He could barely move. My
              partner bravely/stupidly tested the elevator on the 52nd floor. He
              rode it down to the sky lobby on 44. The doors opened, it was
              fine. He rode it back up and got Harry and Victor. I don;t yet
              know if anyone else joined them. Once on 44 they made their way
              back into the stairwell. Someplace around the 39th to 36th floors
              they felt the same rumble I felt on the 3rd floor. It was 10am and
              Tower 2 was coming down. They had about 30 minutes to get out.
              Victor said he could no longer move. They offered to have him lead
              on them. He said he couldn't do it. My partner hollered at him to
              sit on his butt and schooch down the steps. He said he was not
              capable of doing it. Harry told my partner to go ahead of them.
              Harry had once had a heart attack and was worried about this mans
              heart. It was his nature to be this way. He was/is one of the
              kindest people I know. He would not leave a man behind. My partner
              went ahead and made it out. He said he was out maybe 10 minutes
              before the building came down. This means that Harry had maybe 25
              minutes to move Victor 36 floors. I guess they moved 1 floor every
              1.5 minutes. Just a guess. This means Harry wad around the 20th
              floor when the building collapsed. As of now 12 of 13 people are
              accounted for. As of 6pm yesterday his wife had not heard from
              him. I fear that Harry is lost. However, a short while ago I heard
              that he may be alive. Apparently there is a web site with survivor
              names on it and his name appears there. Unfortunately, Ramos is
              not an uncommon name in New York. Pray for him and all those like
              him.</p>
              <p>With regards to the firemen heading upstairs, I realize that
              they were going up anyway. But, it hurts to know that I may have
              made them move quicker to find my friend. Rationally, I know this
              is not true and that I am not the responsible one. The responsible
              ones are in hiding somewhere on this planet and damn them for
              making me feel like this. But they should know that they failed in
              terrorizing us. We were calm. Those men and women that went up
              were heroes in the face of it all. They must have known what was
              going on and they did their jobs. Ordinary people were heroes too.
              Today the images that people around the world equate with power
              and democracy are gone but America is where we want to go on
              vacation. The very moment the first plane was hijacked, democracy
              won.
